Dependencies:

@shopify/polaris: This package provides UI components for building Shopify apps with React. It is used to render components like Button, TextField, Banner, Icon, etc.
react-router-dom: This package provides routing functionality for React applications. It is used to handle navigation within the application using the Link component and the useNavigate hook.
react-redux: This package provides bindings between React and Redux for state management. It is used to connect the component to the Redux store, dispatch actions, and access the global state using the useSelector and useDispatch hooks.
@/redux/slices/accountSlice: This module likely contains Redux slice code related to the account state, including the login action.


Inputs (Props):

LoginLayout: This component is likely a custom component responsible for rendering the layout of the login page. It is passed as a prop to the Login component, and the Login component renders its children within it.
title: A string representing the title of the login page.


Functions:

hanleEmailChange: This function is an event handler for the email input field. It is called when the value of the email input changes and updates the email state variable accordingly.
hanlePwdChange: This function is an event handler for the password input field. It is called when the value of the password input changes and updates the pwd state variable accordingly.
handleSubmit: This function is called when the login form is submitted. It performs form validation, checks if the provided email and password match any user in the users array (assuming it's a global state variable), and handles navigation and dispatching of the login action using Redux.


Integration Points:

Redux Integration: The component uses the useDispatch and useSelector hooks to connect to the Redux store. It dispatches the login action with the user data when successful and accesses the users array from the global state using the useSelector hook.
React Router Integration: The component uses the useNavigate hook from react-router-dom to handle navigation. It calls navigate("/organization") to navigate to the "/organization" route when the login is successful.
Polaris UI Integration: The component uses various components from the @shopify/polaris package to render UI elements such as buttons, text fields, banners, icons, etc.
